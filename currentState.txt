Things todo in schedule iteration:
* respect the function call that came before in selecting staff
* generate a graph to walk through for each function call


Looking at repairDoubles specifically.
I don't understand how the graph is to be used to find a pair to swap with.

between lines 50-70 what happens is:
* possibleSwapPartners = a list of all staff open to work on the double role's day.
* possibleSwapDays = a list days the current double-staff is not working.
* possibleSwapPairs =  pairs from the schedule were the staff is in possibleSwapPairs,
and the role's day is in possibleSwapDays.
These are suitable pairs to repair the double'd shift.

Question: At what point in this process is the graph supposed to take shape?

With repairAvailablity, I added a filter to the list of staff with respect to repairDoubles
and ended up with lines 180-185
Here as well I am struggling to grasp where the graph fits in.

I thought I understood the graph when it was presented,
now that I'm trying to work with it, I am lost in the specifics.
Are you able to reiterate the purpose of introducing the graph again?
