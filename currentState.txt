Working toward finding cycles in a graph.

Two things:
On understanding the different graph algorithms.
Right now they make sense in an abstracted way.
dfs travels through the graph from node to it's neighbors
producing a depth-first path for each node

Stepping through the dfs code is complicated by not fully grasping yield.
I do understand that yield returns a generator,
which when iterated over, then runs the code to return the yielded value...
No, I don't really understand that.

calling dfs and working with dfs to find cycles is now complicated.
