Summary of learning about graphs so far:

Started by following along the article that's listed at the top of graph.py.
From there, collected a few examples from stackExchange to move toward
using a graph with schedule data.

Generators and recursion came up again. Understandable as concepts,
while still a challange to work and think with writing anything specific.

Using someone's exmaple of a Graph class I got to the point of forming
what I think may be a traversable graph from schedule data.

This graph comes from findConnections() in implementGraph.py
and is called in app.py so I could roughly inspect it with VSCode/Flask debugging.
