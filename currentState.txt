repair Availability functions.

Currently, it only respects availablity so that means it probably creates a lot of doubles
The idea of completely moduler repair functions that can be called in any order on a schedule sounds nice,
though I can't think of a way to make it work in practice.

So, that means, adding double checks to the repairAvailability function?
This seems messy. Maybe there's another way? Something to discuss.

Update for repairPreferences:
The questions and uncertainties above apply to repairPreferences
and any repair function that may come after- The bulk of comments shows as much.
This is something to discuss.
