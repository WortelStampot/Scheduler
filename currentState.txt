repair Availability functions.

Currently, it only respects availablity so that means it probably creates a lot of doubles
The idea of completely moduler repair functions that can be called in any order on a schedule sounds nice,
though I can't think of a way to make it work in practice.

So, that means, adding double checks to the repairAvailability function?
This seems messy. Maybe there's another way? Something to discuss.
